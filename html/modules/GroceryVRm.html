                <h4>The Grocery VR project was developed for the Boise School District to use a virtual enviroment
                    instruct students how to navigate a virtual grocery store, retrieve items from a list, and complete
                    transactions with both cash and card payments. The application was intended to be used on Oculus
                    (Meta) VR headsets. Our team inherited the project from a previous group and was provided with a
                    store layout and a diverse set of assets for implementation. <br><br>

                    One significant challenge with the original project revolved around inefficiency. The models had
                    excessively high polygon counts, textures were measured in gigabytes, and transparency effects were
                    overused, resulting in a notably low framerate that could compromise the Virtual Reality experience.
                    To address this issue, I took on the responsibility of optimizing the project's geometry and
                    textures.<br><br>

                    I reconstructed more efficient versions of certain models, creating textures myself. Whenever a team
                    member submitted a model, I meticulously ensured it didn't contain unnecessary geometry, and that
                    textures were appropriately sized. If any element proved burdensome on the hardware, I either
                    streamlined it personally or collaborated with the contributing team member to enhance its
                    efficiency.<br><br>

                    Implementing practical solutions, I introduced a "shelf stocker" class that facilitated the
                    assignment of products to shelves, allowing users to specify quantity and spacing without the need
                    for assigning posisions for every item in the store. This not only streamlined the process but also
                    improved efficiency by deactivating collision when users were out of reach of the shelf.<br><br>

                    I also designed interactive features such as doors for refrigerators, a fruit spawner that
                    intuitively generated fruit in users' hands from a pile, and addressed various bugs throughout the
                    project. These enhancements aimed to optimize performance and create a smoother, more enjoyable
                    Virtual Reality experience.
