                <h4>This project was a group assignment in an engineering course, where our collective efforts were
                    dedicated to a rehabilitation hospital. Our task was to develop a simulation specifically tailored
                    to assist individuals in the process of relearning how to drive after losing the ability to do so
                    after accidents or strokes. The significance of this endeavor was not lost on us, as it resonated
                    with the very essence of engineering, applying our skills to address real-world challenges and make
                    a positive impact. <br><br>
                    Adhering to the client's specifications, the application interface was a steering wheel controller
                    with pedals for the purpose of interacting with a simulated car within a digital environment. The
                    application was programmed to assess various driving parameters, including lane adherence, speed
                    compliance, and complete stops. A comprehensive driver score would be generated at the conclusion of
                    each drive.<br><br>
                    Knowing that our work could play a role in the recovery journey of those overcoming significant
                    health challenges added meaning to our project. The end result could potentially contribute to
                    enhancing the quality of life for individuals on their path to rehabilitation and that made every
                    aspect of our engineering efforts deeply rewarding.
