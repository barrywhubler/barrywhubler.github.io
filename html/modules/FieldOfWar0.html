                <h4>Field of War is a mobile game created in Adobe Animate, it was a collaborative endeavor that served
                    as an introduction to state machines, and the integration of teamwork to produce a cohesive project.
                    My involvement extended to several key facets. <br><br>
                    I created the core of the state machine, and then each team member created a state to plug into the
                    machine that would work within the machine to ensure a dynamic and responsive user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    I created the opening animation, setting the tone for the project. Responsibility for asset creation
                    was divided between the group members, I was responsible for the dragons, archers, and life bars.
                    This intricate pixel artistry not only added a visually engaging dimension to the project but also
                    underscored my commitment to delivering a polished and aesthetically pleasing final product.
                    <br><br>
                    This collaborative venture not only provided a hands-on exploration of state machines but also
                    underscored the significance of teamwork in achieving a harmonious synthesis of diverse
                    contributions, culminating in a functional and visually compelling project.
