                <h4>This Anti-Aircraft Gun was built in Blender and textured using Adobe Photoshop. It was designed for
                    a dynamic gaming experience built in Unity 3D. In this game, machine learning algorithms were
                    employed to train enemy jets, which would autonomously target the player, attempting to eliminate
                    them. The player, equipped with the Anti-Aircraft Gun, faced the challenge of shooting down these
                    enemy jets before they could successfully engage. <br><br>
                    The design of the gun incorporated several animated features to heighten the gaming realism.
                    Notably, the guns had the ability to rotate forward and backward, the turret has lateral rotation,
                    and the tread texture simulated motion, creating the illusion of the tread in motion. These elements
                    contributed to an immersive and engaging gaming environment.
