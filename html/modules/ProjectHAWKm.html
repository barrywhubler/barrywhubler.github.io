                <h4>Developed on the XCode platform for iOS devices, this therapeutic scheduling app is designed with a specialized focus on aiding students with autism in efficiently navigating their class schedules. The application streamlines the scheduling process, allowing therapists to create entries for students by specifying the time and appointment details. <br><br>

                    A distinctive feature of the app unfolds in its augmented reality section. Here, therapists can set up a visual guide for students using a series of strategically placed rings. These augmented reality rings serve as a navigational aid, guiding the student to their designated destination within the educational environment. The therapist's involvement in creating this visual guide ensures a tailored and supportive experience for each student. <br><br>
                    
                    Once the schedule is configured and the augmented reality guide is in place, the student engages with the app on their tablet. Employing an interactive approach, the child utilizes a virtual helicopter interface to navigate through the augmented reality rings, effectively steering themselves toward the specified destination. This process offers a dynamic and engaging means for students to independently traverse their daily schedules.
