                <h4>"Blacksmithery" is a Virtual Reality blacksmith simulator crafted in Unity 3D, serving as my senior capstone project with an array of sophisticated features. This immersive experience guides users through the intricate process of crafting a sword, with  each step presented as a unique and engaging challenge. The simulation encompasses a comprehensive workflowâ€”from smelting iron and molding the blade to honing and testing the finished product on a training dummy. <br><br>

                    A highlight of this project was constructing the dynamic blade model using code in C#. Every vector, polygon, and texture was meticulously crafted through lines of code, a very time-consuming process requiring meticulous planning, whereas shaping a similar form in Blender or Maya would take about 5 seconds.  The coding approach was crucial early on to create an object that dynamically changes shape upon impact with a hammer. Despite now knowing more straightforward methods in Unity, I have no regrets about doing it the way I did.<br><br>
                    
                    There is a save feature that allows users to resume where they left off, regardless of the shape they formed the blade into.  The user is accompanied by adaptive music that changes with workshop progression. During testing, the challenge of retrieving dropped tools led to an intentional design choice: tools automatically return to the workbench upon release.   This feature inadvertently makes it enjoyable to throw the tools at the workbench and watch them fall back into place.<br><br>
                    
                    A notable aspect of user enjoyment emerged during testing, everytime a user was forming the edge of the blade the users would extend the freshly forged blade in front of them and inspect the straight edge that they made, a moment that consistently brought me joy.
